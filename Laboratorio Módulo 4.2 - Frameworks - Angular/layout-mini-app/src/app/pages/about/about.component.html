    <h1>About Momentum</h1>
    <p>A digital capsule for your most meaningful memories...</p>
    <p>
      In a world that moves too fast, it’s easy to let the important moments
      fade away. Momentum was born as a personal time capsule, an intimate space
      to store what truly matters: your emotions, your experiences, your most
      meaningful memories.
      <br />
      This app is not a social network.
      <br />
      It’s your emotional sanctuary. There are no likes, no filters, no
      algorithms deciding what matters. <br />Every memory you save in Momentum
      has value because it’s yours.
      <br />
      You can revisit it whenever you want, feel it again, see how you’ve grown,
      all without the pressure of being seen.
